Project:	We will construct a playable game using Unity for construction and most likely C# for scripting. Art assets will be chosen from those available free online or created by the team. Each team member will contribute to the finished project based.

Game details: We will build a space shooter where the player controls a ship as it travels through space destroying obstacles and enemies in their path and avoiding enemy weapons fire and invincible obstacles.
Players will earn points to build a high score, and collect currency that they can use to upgrade their shipâ€™s capabilities.
There will be several levels (at least one per team member?)

Additional features: (wish list)
Multiple weapons/upgrades
Different ships to choose from
Missions?
Mining
Mobile deployment (android and or IOS)
